						Assalamu alaikum – peace be with you.<br/><br/>

						On behalf of Asian University of Bangladesh (AUB) I extend to you the warmest welcome to our website. Established in 1996, the campus of AUB is situated on a 10 acres of land block with a 10-storied building of floor area 250,000 sq. ft. in Ashulia, Dhaka, Bangladesh. It is one of the largest and most beautiful campuses of all private universities in Bangladesh.<br/><br/>

						I am very humble, and honoured, to be able to serve the country of my birth after teaching/working in many universities in Australia, North America, Europe and the Middle and South East Asia over three decades. I thank the Honourable President of Bangladesh for appointing me as the Vice Chancellor of AUB.<br/><br/>

						AUB believes that the success of our students is our pride.<br/><br/>

						As an old and leading provider of higher education in Bangladesh, AUB is highly committed to provide best available facilities and resources to our students to realise their maximum potential as students and to achieve their career goals.<br/><br/>

						The essence of any university is to create skilled professionals to meet the growing needs of diverse and specialised demands in the national and global job market. As the Bangladeshi economy is growing fast, our nation needs more skilled university graduates to meet the development targets both in the private and public sectors.<br/><br/>

						Adopting appropriate curriculum, syllabus and delivery methods, we are fully committed to ensure all our programs (degrees) and courses fully comply with the Outcome Based Education (OBE) regulatory requirements of University Grants Commission of Bangladesh.<br/><br/>

						At AUB, we operate on the premises that the contemporary workplace requires job-ready graduates. Employers are always in need of highly skilled professionals to work independently and/or a part of a team. In fact, well-educated, hardworking, and honest graduates with the best subject knowledge and communication skills are highly sought after at home and abroad.<br/><br/>

						Highly qualified, dedicated and fully committed teachers are the keys to produce the best graduates. We use appropriate educational technologies and both traditional and digital learning materials to make the learning journey of our students easy and effective.<br/><br/>

						Innovative teaching methods coupled with education technologies for the delivery of course materials, thoughtful assessments and inspirational communications help prepare our students to best fit in the workplace with the ability to solve problems in any working environment.<br/><br/>

						We believe and practice work integrated learning (WIL) approach to enable our students to acquire industry experience and familiarise themselves with the workplace and potential employers before they graduate.<br/><br/>

						We know, although most graduates normally prepare themselves for existing lucrative jobs, the nation and the world are in dire need of new generation of entrepreneurs who could introduce innovation to create opportunities of jobs through introducing new industry, technology, management, goods and services. Our curricula and teaching are reflective of this graduate quality.<br/><br/>

						As per the program and course learning outcomes, our students learn how to analyse and review different problems/issues with a view to assessing any situation/issue, finding solutions, making appropriate workplace modifications and recommending policy changes if appropriate.<br/><br/>

						In addition to imparting conventional and modern discipline knowledge and technical skills, at AUB we emphasise on the importance of excellent oral and written communications skill and teach universal human values to commit to honesty and ethics in their professional and personal lives.<br/><br/>

						Research is a mechanism to generate new knowledge, expand the boundary of current state of technologies and help adopt innovation for the benefit of the society. AUB is fully committed to encourage, prepare and train new generations of researchers along with mentoring and supporting young researchers to enhance their prospective careers.<br/><br/>

						AUB’s institutional culture of teaching and learning excellence, innovative research, hands on training and personal care to the students have given many of our graduates the opportunities to achieve professional distinction at the highest level in Bangladesh and beyond.<br/><br/>

						If anyone is genuinely committed to higher education and building a career through learning and receiving training in a specific discipline in an environment of great care and support, AUB is ready to welcome and provide them the best opportunity to realise their dreams.<br/><br/>

						Thank you for visiting our website and we hope to welcome you in our beautiful campus soon.
