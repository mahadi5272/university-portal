                    It gives me great pleasure to welcome you to the Asian University of Bangladesh, a place of learning and scholarship, engaged in preparing young men and women to face the challenges of the new millennium.<br /><br />

                    In its efforts towards progress and development, Bangladesh needs high-quality human resources, professionally sound and morally upright, equipped with the latest knowledge in multi-disciplinary fields and with technological ability. AUB commits to deliver this to the nation.<br /><br />

                    Established in September 1996, with a few students and only two faculties housed in a small two-storied building, AUB expanded and grew quite fast. It now has five faculties, thirteen departments, and a large number of students. Thus it has emerged as one of the largest private Universities in Bangladesh. This has been achieved despite our efforts to restrict expansion in the face of high demand and pressure from knowledge seekers for admission into our university. Due to AUB's quality education with exposure to real-life situations, AUB graduates are doing very well in the job market at home as well as abroad.<br /><br />

                    If you have made up your mind to excel, make high achievements in life, and contribute to building the nation, you need the best in education and training. AUB's mission is to give this to you.<br /><br />

                    I am sure you will find this website very useful and informative. For additional information, please refer to the AUB office, which will be glad to assist you.<br /><br />

                    Please accept my best personal wishes for your success.<br /><br />
